# Hall of Fame
#
# Points are awarded according to *actual* reward payment sent, ie. the penalty
# for missing PGP is applied to points just as it is to payments.
#
# Each listed participant can have either a GitHub or Twitter link, not both.
#
# "reports" are formatted as "report number: reward amount".
