**Introduction:**

The Decred community welcomes security researchers and bug bounty hunters to find security vulnerabilities in its website and projects. We ask that you respect the following rules and guidelines when testing. 


**Rules:**

All bug reports need to have a clear exploit or POC. 

All bugs must be reproducible in the latest production release or the master branch of the code. 

Bugs in old releases or feature branches are not in scope.

We prohibit DDOS or network bandwidth load testing.

Unfortunately we are unable to pay for duplicate reports

Any type of public disclosure of the vulnerability without prior approval will make it ineligible for bounty.

No social engineering.

No spamming.

All Current/Past (For up-to 6 months) Decred developers are barred from taking part in this bug bounty program.

Vulnerability reports made before the start of the program will not be eligible for a bounty.

**Reminders:**

Almost all of Decred's projects can be run locally and reproduction instruction are available on github. We strongly recommend you to do this.

Always check the "issues" in github of a project to avoid a duplicate report

Use simnet or testnet when possible, do not attempt to attack the mainnet.

Decred project is not responsible for any loss of DCR due to bug testing.

**Payout:**


We will be using the [OWASP Risk Rating Methodology](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology) for scoring and prioritizing vulnerabilities 

We will also take into consideration the impact on the Decred ecosystem. An RCE in dcr-netstats (Low impact) is not the same as an RCE in dcrd or Decrediton (Higher impact)

The following are also factors in the payout:

* Quality of the initial writeup.
* Quality of vulnerability reproduction steps and POC.
* If you provide an actual code fix for the vulnerability then you will also be eligible for a "code fix" bonus on the condition that our existing developers accept it as valid.

All payouts will be in Decred only. You will be required to create and operate a Decred wallet. The DCR to USD ratio is based on the the average USD rate of the previous month. Payout amount is decided by a core "bug bounty" group.



*Indicative payout amounts:*

Note: up to 300 USD

Low: up to 1,000 USD

Medium: up to 3,000 USD

High: up to 10,000 USD

Critical: up to 25,000 USD
