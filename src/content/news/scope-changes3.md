The following projects are no longer in scope of the bounty program:

- dcrweb
- politeia
- testnetfaucet
- dcrdata

These sites generated a disproportionately high volume of low-quality and spam
reports, despite handling no funds and having no critical role in the operation
of the Decred blockchain.

Removing them from the bounty program should help direct bug hunters toward more
impactful systems.
